routing

for now, this microservice is just going to be a pure api that will be consumed by nginx via the frontend webpack-dev-server.

nginx will redirect /api to localhost:3001/, so basically stripping the initial path which would be redunant.

we're going to take a rest approach to this problem right now, but I want it to be graph-based.

routes:

app.post('/matches/log')
body: winner, loser
reqs: both fields need to match things already in the database. As a result, the design should be changed to a select. This also means we need the ability to add a new player.

app.get('/standings)
body: ordered set of players from top to bottom.

app.post('/players/new)
body: name
